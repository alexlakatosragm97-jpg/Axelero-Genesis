## What it does
- 🎯 **Auto-detects your active game** (foreground focus)
- ⚡ **Process priority boost** (safe OS-level tuning)
- 🔋 **Windows Power Plan switching** (High/Ultimate Performance where available)
- 🧠 **Stability-first logic** (cooldowns + lock-hold to avoid constant switching)
- 🧩 **Launcher-aware** (Epic/Steam style handoff → game process)

---

## Supported
- **Windows 10 / 11**
- **NVIDIA GPUs (tested on RTX 3060 Ti / 30-series, expanding)**

## How to use (30 seconds)
1. Download & run **Axelero Genesis**
2. Start your game (or launcher → game)
3. When the game is detected, Axelero switches to **ACTIVE** and applies safe boosts
4. Close the game → Axelero returns to standby (best-effort)

## Safety / Transparency
Axelero Genesis focuses on **OS-level tuning** only:
- ✅ Process priority / affinity (optional)
- ✅ Power plan selection (best-effort)
- ✅ Foreground-game detection

It **does not**:
- ❌ Modify game files
- ❌ Inject into the game
- ❌ Overclock GPU

> Results vary by game, system load, driver settings, and background apps.

## FAQ
**Does it increase FPS?**  
It aims to improve **frame stability** (less stutter / better pacing). Some games may show FPS gains; others mainly feel smoother.

**Is it anti-cheat safe?**  
It avoids injection and file edits. However, **every game/anti-cheat is different** — use at your own discretion.

**Why does it show “STANDBY”?**  
No valid game window is detected, or you’re focused on desktop/background apps.

## Roadmap (next)
- More GPU detection details + reporting
- Better UI polish (dynamic glow / ring effects)
- Profiles per game (safe presets)
